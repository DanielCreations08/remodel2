            <h2>How Much Does It Cost to Paint a House?</h2>
            <p>This is one of the most frequently asked questions when considering a painting project. The cost of painting a house depends on several factors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Size of Your Home:</strong> Larger homes require more paint and labor.</li>
                <li><strong>Interior Painting Costs:</strong> Prices are calculated by the square footage of the wall surface area. Multiply the height by the width by the length of the walls. Additional upgrades like painting trim, doors, and closets will increase the overall price.</li>
                <li><strong>Exterior Painting Costs:</strong> Exterior painting typically costs more due to the need for prep work and higher material costs to withstand the elements. Upgrades such as painting windows, gutters, soffits, and fascia will also affect the price.</li>
                <li><strong>Type of Paint:</strong> High-quality paints cost more but last longer and look better.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>On average:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Interior Painting Costs:</strong> $2,000–$5,000 depending on square footage and upgrades.</li>
                <li><strong>Exterior Painting Costs:</strong> $3,000–$7,000 depending on the condition of the surfaces, prep work required, and additional upgrades.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Our Best Practices for a Picture-Perfect Finish</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wall Preparation:</strong> Sanding, spackling nail holes, and addressing imperfections for a flawless finish.</li>
                <li><strong>Patching and Skim Coating:</strong> Fix larger holes with patching or use skim coating for a smooth surface. Level 3 handles most imperfections; Level 5 achieves a brand-new look.</li>
                <li><strong>Crack Repairs:</strong> Repair cracks over doors, windows, and joints, and address nail or screw poppers with precision.</li>
                <li><strong>Outlet Covers and Trim:</strong> Remove covers before painting and reinstall afterward. Perfect trim with filled holes and caulked edges.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Oil-Based Primer: The Secret Sauce for Stained Surfaces</h2>
            <p>Stained trim, doors, or windows are a different beast. Without the right prep, stains can bleed through and ruin the finish. That’s where oil-based primer comes in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Blocks stains, ensuring no unsightly blemishes appear.</li>
                <li>Creates a superior bond, helping the topcoat adhere beautifully to the surface.</li>
                <li>Provides a durable base for long-lasting results.</li>
            </ul>
