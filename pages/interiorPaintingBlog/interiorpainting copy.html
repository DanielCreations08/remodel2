            <h2>🎨 Why Two Coats Are a Must-Have</h2>
            <p>Picture this: your walls are freshly painted, but as the sun shifts, you spot faint, uneven patches—welcome to the world of "holidays." In painting lingo, holidays are light spots that result from uneven coverage, often along the top cut line where walls meet the ceiling. The culprit? A single coat of paint.</p>
            <p>Two coats aren’t just extra work; they’re your insurance against these pesky blemishes. With two coats, you achieve uniform coverage, deeper color, and a professional finish. Plus, it ensures durability, so your walls stay beautiful for years to come. After all, nobody wants a paint job that’s mood-dependent on the angle of the light!</p>

            <h2>🖌️ Our Best Practices for a Picture-Perfect Finish</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wall Preparation:</strong> Sanding, spackling nail holes, and addressing imperfections for a flawless finish.</li>
                <li><strong>Patching and Skim Coating:</strong> Fix larger holes with patching or use skim coating for a smooth surface. Level 3 handles most imperfections; Level 5 achieves a brand-new look.</li>
                <li><strong>Crack Repairs:</strong> Repair cracks over doors, windows, and joints, and address nail or screw poppers with precision.</li>
                <li><strong>Outlet Covers and Trim:</strong> Remove covers before painting and reinstall afterward. Perfect trim with filled holes and caulked edges.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>🏡 Oil-Based Primer: The Secret Sauce for Stained Surfaces</h2>
            <p>Stained trim, doors, or windows are a different beast. Without the right prep, stains can bleed through and ruin the finish. That’s where oil-based primer comes in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Blocks stains, ensuring no unsightly blemishes appear.</li>
                <li>Creates a superior bond, helping the topcoat adhere beautifully to the surface.</li>
                <li>Provides a durable base for long-lasting results.</li>
            </ul>
